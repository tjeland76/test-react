      summary: 'This year the event was held at the London Aquatic Centre, bringing together over 10 thousand swimmers from all over Europe.',
      body: 'Eight Warrington Masters swimmers competed at the Swimnorthwest Masters event on 20th February. Due to the forthcoming European Masters event, the meet was well attended, with both distance and sprint events on offer. Russ Mason’s tough winter training schedule paid dividends. He had a superb meet, winning 5 gold medals including 4 All-comers and 4 North West records with particularly good swims in his ( less-often competed in) 200m events. Chris Rix celebrated going up to the next age group by winning 4 golds including 3 North West records and one All-comers record, and Graeme Atherton had some impressive swims with 3 victories, including 2 North West Records and one all-comers record. Andy Bennett swam superbly to win a silver and 3 bronze, just narrowly missing out on the most improved swimmer award. Graham Padgett won 4 golds in fine style despite being at the top of his age group. Jackie Carribine (pictured above) earned an excellent silver in the 100m breaststroke, and a bronze in the 50m breaststroke. Judy Brown, coming back to Regional level competition after a 2-year lay off, had a busy schedule and swam well to claim 4 golds, including 3 North-west records and one All-comers record, and 3 silvers. Derek Booth competed really well to earn 4 golds and a silver. A great start to the season for Warrington Masters swimmers !',

      summary: 'This year the event was held at the London Aquatic Centre, bringing together over 10 thousand swimmers from all over Europe.',
      body: 'Five swimmers represented Warrington Masters last Saturday at Southport, bringing home 6 Warrington Masters records, 15 golds, 4 silvers and 2 bronze, with four swimmers winning prizes for being the best swimmer in their age group. Unfortunately, there weren’t as many swimmers attending as in the past, so races followed in rapid succession and the gala was completed within the hour, but was enjoyable nonetheless. Rob Saile was the first swimmer to swim under our new club name and, in his first ever Masters gala, stormed home to win his age group in 1:23.30 Swims of 45.56 (50 backstroke) and 37.84 (50 freestyle) earned him two more first places and the ‘best in age’ award. Well done Rob ! Jackie Carribine bounced back to form and fitness following recent illness with a new Warrington Masters record and very impressive swim of 39.09 for 50m breaststroke. A fine first place in the 100 IM along with some good swims in the 50 and 100m freestyle events was sufficient to gain her the best overall swimmer in her age group award. Derek Booth had some excellent swims and came away with 5 golds, a silver and the best in age award. Carolyn Bailey also swam some excellent times in a competitive age group, but unfortunately lost her bet with Rob on the 50 freestyle, so she now owes him a glass of wine ! Judy Brown made the mistake of attempting a 50 fly in the race following the 100m IM and almost grounded to a halt but thankfully the wall arrived just in time. No marks for style ! The event was thoroughly enjoyed by all . The last race was a 4x25 relay – Rob had to dash but the organisers were forgiving with the definition of ‘mixed’ relay and let us swim with 1 man and 3 women. Jackie drew the short straw of having to compete against the men, but just held off a male opponent on the last length, and we finished 3rd out of the 4 teams A big thanks to Helen Jenkins of Southport SC for organising the gala. Probably, the change in timing has affected the turnout so hopefully there’ll be a few more entries next time.',

      body: 'The European Masters Championships, held at the London Aquatic Centre, brought together over 10 thousand swimmers from all over Europe, ensuring that the quality of the swimming was extremely high. The event was spread over 5 days, with races starting as early as 7:30am and finishing close to midnight. Eight Warrington Masters members attended the event, pulling off 9 top-20 finishes out of the 14 races in which they competed – an excellent achievement given such a high standard of swimming, with most of the top swimmers from all over Europe participating in each age group and category. Judy Brown competed in 2 events. She came back very strongly over the second 100m of her 200m backstroke event to take the silver medal, and smash the British record in the 50-54 age group by over 4 seconds. This was followed up with a fine bronze medal in the 100m backstroke the following day. Derek Booth received a diploma for his excellent 100m butterfly , where he finished in 7th place. He also had some good swims in the 100m and 50m freestyle, finishing in 11th and 18th place respectively. Graeme Atherton turned in a great 100m butterfly swim to finish 12th, with fast-improving Jackie Carribine achieving 2 top-20 finishes for her 200m Individual Medley and 200m Breaststroke. Gerry Kelleher took on the extremely demanding 200m butterfly event and finished in a very creditable 15th place. Andy Bennett, Steve Connor and Richard Taylor all swam very well in the extremely popular sprint freestyle events.',

The performances were so good that 32 out of the 37 individual results swum (86 % !) were 1 year PBs - massive credit goes to our coach Jonathan Gatley for all his efforts (despite all our moans, groans and excuses !)</p><p>The men’s relay teams take pride of place – a marvellous effort from Graeme, Chris, Russ and Trev. Trev’s 50 splits would have won him the 50 free in the individual event!! The freestyle team broke the 2 metres per second barrier with 1:39.79 to win silver, before going on to become National Champions in the two medley relays with 2 more brilliant swims.</p><p>In the individual events :- Chris repeated his double gold of last year with superb victories in the 200m back and 200m freestyle. In addition, he had two excellent swims in the 200m Individual Medley and 100m backstroke to earn him a silver and a bronze respectively. Graeme pulled off a fantastic swim to become the National 100m fly Champion in a time of 1:01.15! Russ took on 11 swims over the week-end (including the relays) and swam superbly in every one of them. Unlucky not to get a gold, he nevertheless claimed 3 silvers and a bronze. Despite being at the top of her age group, Pat won 2 golds and 2 silvers, 3 of the swims being one year PBs. Phil swam his best times ever in Masters competitions, and achieved a well-earned bronze medal in the 400m freestyle. Gerry took on the 200 fly and had an excellent swim to claim bronze in a ‘best time for a long time’ of 3:06.27. Jackie swam really well all week-end and was extremely unlucky not to get a medal, missing out by 10ths of a second in 2 of her races, and achieving 3 fourth places. Massive improvement and undoubtedly much more to come. Judy got off to a great start with a gold and a British record of 2:36.38 in the 200m backstroke. This was followed up with a win in the 400m Individual medley, and a silver in the 100m freestyle. A great battle was had in the 200m Individual medley, but unfortunately she was just touched out to win silver, again in a season’s best time. A much improved 200m freestyle of 2:24 earned bronze, followed by a 100m IM bronze and a silver in the 800m to complete the meet.</p><p>In summary, a huge congratulations to all our swimmers on a marvellous team effort, and many thanks to everyone for their support!

Two more North West All-comers records in the 400m and 800m completed a brilliant days’ swimming.</p><p>Newcomer Rachel Byrne demonstrated her outstanding ability with 2 gold medals in the 200m Individual Medley and 100m Backstroke, the former being a new all-comers record. With two further silver medals in the 100m freestyle and 100m breaststroke, it was an excellent debut in this Masters competition. Jackie Carribine had an incredibly successful day with 4 gold medals, including breaking the 3 minutes barrier for 200metres breaststroke for the first time in Masters competition – a new all-comers record. Demonstrating really impressive improvement across all her events, she also picked up golds for the 1500m, 50m fly and 50m backstroke. Andy Bennett swam 2 lifetime pbs in the 100m and 200m freestyle events. He took 2 golds in the 50m and 100m freestyle, silver in the 50m fly, and a bronze in the 200m freestyle completed his set of medals. Mark Jones took on a really demanding schedule of 9 races, winning an incredible 6 golds, 2 silvers and 1 bronze , including 3 All-comers records. Phil Woods took on a couple of demanding races – the 800m freestyle and 400m Individual Medley. He was rewarded with a gold for the 800m in a new North West all-comers record, and a silver in the 400m Individual medley – both results were one year pbs. Andy Jones notched up 5 one-year pbs, and earned a silver in the 50m freestyle. His 100m Individual Medley swim was considerably faster than previously swum. Club Chairman Graeme Atherton won a hat-trick of golds with 3 excellent swims. He won the 50m and 100m fly in North West all-comers record times, and a fine gold in his rarely-swum event, the 50m backstroke completed the hat-trick. Judy Brown had a successful day with 4 gold medals in the 200m butterfly, 200m freestyle and 200m medley events, and the 1500m freestyle to finish. She ensured that the club didn’t go without a DQ by doing a (lazy !) backstroke turn that was so slow that it was illegal ! Time to practice turning with both arms. In addition to individual successes, the club entered 3 relay teams, winning 2 golds and 1 silver for the Mens freestyle and medley teams, and the Mixed medley team respectively. So an incredibly successful meet had by everyone – well done all.</p>',

He also swam a strong 50 breaststroke of 43.40. Mark Jones had a very busy evening, swimming in every race, and was rewarded by winning the ‘best in age’ award in the 55-59 years group. Judy Brown had 3 strong swims in the 100 free, 100 IM and 50 free, becoming the third Warrington Masters swimmer to win their age group.</p><p>The relays were as enjoyable as ever.

Jackie broke the 3mins barrier for the first time in Masters swimming over 200m breaststroke – another new club record. Mark swam well in his key events amongst a busy itinerary of (no less than) 11 races ! Two great swims from Carolyn, her 100m freestyle being a new club record, with Derek also swimming well to take five golds and a silver. Judy swam a strong 200m backstroke, and 3 more wins took her to 4 golds in total.

      summary: 'Warrington Masters swimmers had a massive medal haul of 10 golds, 11 silvers and 8 bronze, claiming a new European Record in the men’s 4x 200m freestyle team, and a new British Record in the women’s 100m backstroke',
        body: '<p>Warrington Masters swimmers had a massive medal haul of 10 golds, 11 silvers and 8 bronze, claiming a new European Record in the men’s 4x 200m freestyle team, and a new British Record in the women’s 100m backstroke. Pride of place goes to our superb men’s 200+ relay. The team of Russ, Mark, Andrew and Chris swam brilliantly to not only smash the British record, but also take 3 seconds off the European mark. Huge congratulations to the team on this fantastic achievement!</p><p>In addition, Chris added to his medal tally further by winning a hat-trick of individual golds in the 200m freestyle, 200m backstroke and 400m freestyle events. Judy also had a really successful meet, taking the British Record in the 100m backstroke with an excellent swim of 1:11.64. As well as this, she won 3 further golds in the 400m Individual Medley, 200m backstroke and 200m Individual Medley events. Competing in seven individual races over the week-end, she also won silver medals for 200m freestyle and 200m butterfly, and a bronze for 800m freestyle. Mark added to his relay gold with a fine win in the 1500m event. He followed this up with silvers in the 800m and 400m freestyle and a bronze in the 400m Individual Medley event. In addition to his 2 relay golds, Russ won two silvers - for 100m backstroke and 50m breaststroke, and 3 bronze - for 100m freestyle, 50m backstroke and 100m Individual Medley. An excellent performance, particularly at the top end of the age group.</p><p>Trev took on three 50m sprint events to claim a silver in each, and Jackie had 3 fine swims in the 200m breaststroke, 800m freestyle and 1500m freestyle to claim a silver and 2 bronze. We also enjoyed further medal success in two relay events when the mixed medley team of Judy, Jackie, Graeme and Phil took the silver medal, and the mens medley team of Chris, Russ, Graeme and Phil took the bronze. In addition to his relay success, Andrew swam 2 pbs for 50m and 100m freestyle, the 50m swim earning him a new club record of 26.14, and Graeme had 3 strong swims in a very competitive age group. Gerry, at the top end of his age group, produced a season’s best swim to claim 5th place in the 200m butterfly, and Lauren claimed four Warrington Masters records which will undoubtedly stand her in good stead for the National para swimming Championships later on in the year. Phil swam a new club record in the 800m, and was unlucky to finish 0.7 of a second behind the silver medallist and .02 behind the bronze. Next year’s change of age group has surely got to bring a change of fortune!</p><p>Altogether, our swimmers broke 26 club records – over 50% of all the swims. Congratulations to all on such a brilliant team performance, and many thanks to Jonathan, Paul and Tommi for all the coaching.Full results at <a href="http://swimmingresults.org.uk/masters/results/2017/semas17/">here</a></p>',
